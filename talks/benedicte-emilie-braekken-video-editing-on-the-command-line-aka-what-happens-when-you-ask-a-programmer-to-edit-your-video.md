The story of this talk started an afternoon when I was just trying to compress a video file I had lying around. Of course I wanted to do it from the command line. This ended up pulling me down into a rabbit hole of digital video, codecs and compression schemes. I'm now poking my head up to tell you all about it! Everything from how to edit video in your favourite shell and with your favourite coding language, to the inner workings of video and what makes it so clever. And just a little about how all of this is heavily used in the products that surround us every day. Live demos included. While being a complex topic, it's not as magic as you might think. Let's demystify video together!
