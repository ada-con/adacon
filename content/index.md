title: About Ada Con
---

Ada Con Norway is a yearly conference, arranged by Tech Women Norway, to
celebrate Norwegian women and non-binary people that are Individual Contributors
in Tech.

The conference gives women and non-binary people the platform to give engaging
presentations about their work and fields.

The jury selection is based on hands-on contributions and not on role or career
path within tech. Acknowledging that many contributions are often not publicly
visible, we try to enumerate contributions as well as we can. The people
presented here serve as role-models for folks in Norway trying to build a career
working hands-on in tech.

Additionally, we present our Tech Role Models of 2023. The role models are
selected in collaboration with an independent jury and presented at the Ada
Lovelace mini-conference.
