Marta’s first IT job was to write an open source web UI for a popular configuration management tool she’s never heard of before. Now, she is an Infrastructure Developer at finn.no. Marta maintains Finn’s Kubernetes ecosystem, where 600 microservices work together to help users make better choices for themselves and for society. She is a strong believer in DevOps and not settling for crappy software.

Before switching to IT in 2013, she spent a decade working and volunteering in Polish non-governmental organizations focusing on environmental protection and animal rights. She also worked as a Polish-English-Polish translator.

She enjoys the complexity of computer systems, debugging, collaborating, and camping in the woods.
