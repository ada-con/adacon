Lara Okafor (they/them) is a writer, software developer, and organiser. They are interested in prison abolition, speculative fiction, queerness, and how those topics overlap with technology. Lara has a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Computer Science. They have written a thesis about digital security for queer people of colour, a short story (‘Sevenfold’) which was published in the Norwegian sci-fi anthology ‘A Line Through Gravity’, and several pieces published in the magazines Fett, Billedkunst, and Samora Forum. Lara was one of the project coordinators for the Norwegian documentary film project ‘Loud and Proud: a celebration of Black queer voices’ and was in the organising team for ‘Cutie.BIPoC 2020’ (a festival for queer people of colour). They also hold workshops and talks about topics usually within (and between) the fields of art, technology, and activism.
