Marta Paciorkowska, an infrastructure developer at Finn.no, discusses her career path in technology and the four major shifts in IT infrastructure since Marta began working in the field.

In the first part of the video, Marta describes her background. Marta originally aspired to be a cosmonaut but later switched to astronomy. Despite her early interest in science and technology, Marta ended up studying English literature and pursuing a different career path. Eventually, Marta returned to technology seven years ago.

The second part of the video focuses on Marta's perspective on IT infrastructure. Marta highlights four key changes that have occurred since Marta started working in this field. The first shift is the move from owning software to purchasing access to it. The second shift is the outsourcing of operational tasks to cloud providers. The third shift is the adoption of microservice architecture. Finally, the fourth shift is the increased discussion regarding the environmental and societal effects of technology.
