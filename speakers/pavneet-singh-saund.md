Pavneet has more than 15 years experience working with software development, working from backend systems to the web and front-end technologies. He has had several roles with responsibilities for front-end technology and also leading teams. Currently Pavneet is working as a Senior Frontend Developer at Davidhorn.

Through his many years of working across different industries, he has recognised the value of building software that attend to actual needs. This has often translated having a holistic product mindset when approaching software. This also means attending to needs of the people building. He believes that how a product is built is equally important to the product itself. In his free time he can be found running in the woods, or spending time with his family and pets.
