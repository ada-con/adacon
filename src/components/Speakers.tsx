						We plan a full day conference with talks and workshops. We are
						looking for members of the tech scene in Norway that are hands-on
						creators, builders, and makers of technology. We want to see those
						who love to share about a topic or a project that matters to them
						and that the audience will benefit from learning about. We do not
						care about experience as a speaker. We will pair all our speakers
						with a personal coach to help prepare for the event.
