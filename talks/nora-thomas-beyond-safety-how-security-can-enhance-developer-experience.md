Is security slowing down your development process for you as a developer? This talk aims to change that perception. We will present real case studies showcasing how systems with high security requirements can still be responsive, user friendly, and easy for developers to work with.

Learn about the security code patterns that enable development efficiency, user friendliness, and response speed, with examples from the Vipps MobilePay login system that handles over 1.2 billion user logins per year.
