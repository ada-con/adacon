Caroline works as a data engineer at NAV IT. Since completing her engineering-degree in 2012, she has worked both as a power market analyst and in the data processing team for the New Zealand census. She now works with welfare statistics, and has discovered the many benefits of using dbt (data build tool) in their data transformations. She likes to spend her spare time outdoors, and you will often find her sampling the different rock climbing spots around Oslo.
