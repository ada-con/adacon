I don't like to label myself – but it _is_ true that I've programmed a whole lot more for the web than I have for hardware. I do love games though, and especially old ones. So when the GameBoy – which is a portable game console from the 90s just FYI – modding scene on YouTube suddenly took off again I was inspired to take all my old cartridges out! And after playing for a bit I thought – how hard is it actually to program one of these?
Turns out it's not exactly hard, just a whole bunch of work. And you have to remember all those informatics courses from Uni. Join me for a little dive into the world of pixel art, bits and memory addresses while I tell you about my experiences picking up GameBoy programming and how you can do it too!
