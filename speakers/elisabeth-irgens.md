Elisabeth attended a CSS course back in 2006, and has been writing code for a living ever since. She still doesn’t fit the industry mold for a frontend developer, and has by now revolted against any notion that standardized skill sets are beneficial to the team sport of software development anyway. Today she’s having a blast at Amedia Produkt og Teknologi, wrangling Node.js apps that make up the micro-frontend architecture for 100+ local editorial media sites from around Norway.
