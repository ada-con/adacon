Graduated from NTH in Electronics/Telecommunication in 1991. I worked with modem and low-level protocol development at Nera for 15 years before joining the audio team at Tandberg in 2007. During my time at Tandberg, I learned about Test Driven Development and the concept of building quality into software, which I still find both relieving and fascinating, albeit challenging.

I enjoyed working with real-time challenges and jitter handling in the C programming language for several years. Later, I transitioned to working with C++ in the Meeting Setup area, where I was surprised by how much there was to learn just by moving teams internally.
