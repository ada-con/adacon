As developers we are always learning new things and developing our skills. Most of our learning is done at work as we solve new problems and bang our heads against brick walls. However, when learning a new language it can be difficult to get started. Tutorials are generally boring and the learning from them is minimal. Most of us are learners by doers. We learn more from trying and failing and trying again than we do from following a neat and clean "everything works on the first try" tutorial. In this talk I will talk about how I learned C# by programming the board game pandemic and why you should do the same the next time you want to learn a new language.
