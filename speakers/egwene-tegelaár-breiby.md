After having completed a degree in International Politics, Egwene decided to take a single course ("enkeltemne") in informatics and well, here we are 8 years and a masters degree later 👩🏻‍💻 Egwene has three years experience in frontend and cross platform development from several start-ups and larger organisations. When asked about her dream job in her first job interview all those years ago, the answer was iOS. The dream did eventually come true one year ago when she stared as an iOS/tvOS developer at NRK✨ When Egwene is not working, she is dreaming up new app ideas, pursuing a degree in classical archaeology, and knitting her wardrobe.
