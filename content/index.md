title:
  A yearly conference celebrating Norwegian women and non-binary people in Tech
---

Ada Con Norway is proud to announce the return of its conference in 2023,
celebrating the diversity of the Norwegian tech scene. The event, which was
formerly known as [Tech Women Norway](https://techwomen.no/), will be held on
Ada Lovelace Day, Tuesday, 10.10.2023, at Rebel, Universitetsgata 2, 0164 Oslo.

We are excited to bring Ada Con Norway back after four years. We believe that
diversity efforts need to be intersectional, and our new name reflects this
commitment. We are looking forward to bringing together a community of
individuals who are passionate about promoting diversity in tech.

Ada Con Norway aims to promote and empower under-indexed people in tech by
showcasing a lineup of speakers and workshops from diverse backgrounds. The jury
selection is based on hands-on contributions and not on role or career path
within tech. Acknowledging that many contributions are often not publicly
visible, we try to enumerate contributions as well as we can. The people
presented here serve as role-models for folks in Norway trying to build a career
working hands-on in tech.

## Tech Role Models of 2023

Additionally, we present our Tech Role Models of 2023. The role models are
selected in collaboration with an independent jury and presented at the Ada
Lovelace mini-conference.

And for that we need YOUR input. Please suggest people you would love to be
recognized using our [submission form](https://forms.gle/TKLe2RGPQm4pS3v79).
