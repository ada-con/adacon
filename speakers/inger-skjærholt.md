Inger is a data engineer currently working at NoA Ignite as a consultant. She started her career as a mechanical engineer, before realizing that coding is where her heart is. She is passionate about creating robust, readable code that is expandable and maintainable. Her spare time is spent reading, playing board games and getting her ass kicked by bosses in Lies of P on PS5.
