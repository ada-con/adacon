In tech, we’re always learning and pushing the limits of what we know. Finding peace with this constant evolution requires a growth-oriented mindset. In this session, I’ll share my experience of expanding my comfort zone from data science into cloud infrastructure, focusing on how to build and host a data app in the cloud. We’ll get into the tech details, and by the end, you’ll know how to create a secure, shareable data app yourself. Along the way, we’ll also reflect on how to embrace the fun and challenge of always growing and learning.
