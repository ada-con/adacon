Nora loves music, coffee, plants, and databases—perhaps in that order. She founded and organized the Oslo Code Club during her university years and even taught coding to children in Perugia, Italy, without knowing a word of Italian. These days, she’s busy bringing smart meter data to the cloud. For this year's presentation she's looking back at a past project; creating a Swiss Army knife of a simulation tool for power grid planners.
