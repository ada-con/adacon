Anshika has 10 years experience developing software at Posten Bring - Norwegian National Postal Service, building logistics systems and APIs that enable millions of people in the Nordics to order and receive packages. She values studying users, and fostering cross-departmental collaboration to demystify unruly business rules. A typical day at work involves climbing stairs to the 17th floor of Posten Bringâ€™s towering headquarters in the heart of Oslo, where she will transform whiteboard scribbles into deployed features. Off-duty you'll find her chasing sunsets and culinary adventures, sampling flavours from around the globe.
