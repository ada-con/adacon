Ågot has always been interested in how machines and systems work, and broke the home computer at age 12 in an attempt to fix it. They took a masters degree in mathematics, even though they have dyscalculia, just to figure out how numbers work. After many years of watching the world burn, they realized someone needs step up, and is now doing cyber incident response.
