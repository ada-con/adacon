Tora holds a Master's degree in Cybernetics and Robotics from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), and currently works at the product development and design firm Inventas. There, she has been engaged in comprehensive product development and gained experience in creating products with both physical and digital aspects - both hardware and software. She has a keen interest in exploring connections between technical disciplines and design methodologies, with a focus on user-centered approaches. Her enthusiasm for design methodologies led her to pursue courses in service innovation and design methodology at the University of Stavanger (UiS), further expanding her knowledge. With a heavy technical engineering background, her meeting with the design thinking mentality has led to numerous "aha"-moments.

## Bridging Engineering and Design

Through collaborations with designers and product developers at Inventas and a deep dive into design methodologies and service innovation, I realized my previous perspectives on design needed reevaluation.

I don't want to choose between being an engineer or a designer; my aim is to be an engineer actively involved in design. Discover with me the exciting intersection of engineering and design, where innovation and creative solutions flourish.
