Alexandra has more than 10 years of experience in product related roles from key Norwegian tech companies. She is currently a Principal Product Manager at BRYTER.

Before weaseling her way into tech via open source community management, Alexandra spent a decade on opera and concert stages all over Europe as a hopeful but ultimately not very successful soprano.
