Cecilia Lærk, a cyber security engineer at ABB, argues that communication is important in security. We need to find a way to convey our message in a way that people understand and use simple language to avoid jargon. Ownership is also important. People care more about security if they feel like part of something, and everyone has a role to play. Finally, clarity is essential. We need to explain things in a simple way that everyone can understand and use stories and examples that people can relate to.
