As a technical blogger and event organizer, I'm always curious about my website traffic. How many visitors have I had? Where are they from? What days and times are my websites most popular? Which posts are read the most? ðŸ¤”

All of this information is available to me. There's only one gotcha: the data is only available for the past 30 days. That means if I want to compare how my website is doing next year compared to this year, I need to save the data somewhere else so it doesn't get lost - and build my own visualizations on top of it. Luckily for me, that's what I do for a living! ðŸ¤“

In this session, I will show you how I've used Microsoft Fabric (the newest analytical service from Microsoft) to create my own pocket-sized dashboard for my website analytics. First, I will explain how I automatically collect the data from an API and store it in a central location. Then, I will show how I visualize the data in a mobile-friendly way using Power BI. ðŸ“ˆ
