Silje Ljosland Bakke is a registered nurse and a health IT implementation specialist. Silje is talking about the challenges of health IT and why it is not as advanced as other industries, such as banking. Silje argues that the fragmentation of the healthcare system, legacy systems, and the complexity of healthcare information are some of the main reasons for this. Silje also discusses some of the ways that are being used to address these challenges, such as open specifications and standards, open platforms, and multi-level modeling. Finally, Silje emphasizes the importance of structuring healthcare information while also allowing for free text to capture nuances.
