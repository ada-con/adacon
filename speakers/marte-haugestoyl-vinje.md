Meet the mischievous code ninja - Marte! Marte is a fullstack and DevOps developer from Norway who loves anything nerdy and playful. Her coding companions are her trusty rubber duck and purple mechanical keyboard, and since she graduated in 2022 she's been living by the principle of "pushing her boundaries" to make the world her playground. To describe herself as a coder, she would say "lazy perfectionist", while also loving a good mind puzzle and being a child at heart. ðŸ§¸

## DevOps x Chaos Engineering ðŸ‘¾

Marte will talk about the intersection of DevOps and Chaos Engineering including a live-demo.
