Haimanot Tekie is a senior full-stack developer with 8 years of experience, currently working at NAV. Born in Ethiopia in 1989 and raised in Eritrea, she moved to Norway at 16. Haimanot began her career improving complex logistics and banking systems using Java, later transitioning to Kotlin and frontend development at FINN and Diffia, a scale-up e-health company. She values collaboration with product owners, designers, and testers and believes her "superpower" is the courage to ask questions and learn from others.

A passionate learner, Haimanot draws inspiration from Frontend Masters courses by Brian Holt and Will Sentance, aspiring to become a technical communicator. Outside of work, her relationship with Jesus is central to her life, and she actively participates in church, enjoys time with her husband and two children (born in 2010 and 2014), and volunteers with her kids' local basketball team.
