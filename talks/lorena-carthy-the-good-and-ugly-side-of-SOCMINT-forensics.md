Lorena Carthy, a forensic investigator at PwC, defines social media intelligence forensics (SOCMINT) as the collecting evidence from social media platforms that can and will be used in court. She argues that SOCMINT is a powerful tool that can be used to investigate crimes and identify criminals. However, she also warns that SOCMINT can be misused and that people should be careful about what they share on social media.
