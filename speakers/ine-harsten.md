Born: November 1943, Arendal, Norway. I’ve always suspected I was conceived during victory celebrations in occupied Norway, after Paulus’ capitulation at Stalingrad. Never had the courage to ask.

Grew up on the Norwegian south coast, Sørlandet. Elementary school from 1950 – 1958.

1958 – 62 : High School, Gymnasium: Hornnes off Landsgymnas

1962 – 63 : Schipyard practice, at Kristiansand. For my NTH studies

1963 – 68 : Norwegian Institute of technology (NTH), now NTNU Trondheim. Electrical Engineering. Wrote my first Algol programs 1965, Univac 1107.

1969 – 70 : Further studies at University of Oslo.

1970 – 77 : Worked for NAVF with developing software and database systems for the Social Sciences at Norwegian Universities. Hardware mainly CDC 3000 and Univac 1110, briefly Dec 1080 (1976-77). Programming languages FORTRAN and CDC Assembler. Main project: a database system for Norwegian official statistical data (from SSB). And a lot of ad hoc programming in order to solve compatibility problems between Norwegian universities. Bergen University had a tendency to send us ASCII as 9 bits when they had the Univac 1110 (36 bits machine).

1977 – 82 : Norwegian Coop, project manager for a distributed warehouse system. That project was in a total catastrophic state when I started, we managed to implement it fairly successfully during spring 1981. Made too many enemies during that project, and left 1982. Programming languages: Burrough (later Unisys) Extended Algol, Work Flow, MCP operating system, DMSII database systems. Resulted in me falling in love with Burroughs system software and programming languages for the rest of my life. Interesting software, with OPSYS (MCP) written in high level programs (Extended ALGOL and SNOBOL)

1982 – 84 : Project manager for Fellesdata, data service for the Norwegian Savings Banks. Project manager for the evaluation of new terminal systems for the banks.

1984 – 94 : Independent consultant. Project included:

- Wrote customer systems for Norwegian Savings Banks.
- Wrote booking system for Gullivers Reiser A/S, small Norwegian tour operator. System worked from day one and quickly transformed Gulliver from a niche operator to a medium sized operator on the Norwegian market. Rewrote to different computer architecture  1989 – 90. Algol & COBOL & WFL.
- 1985 – 86 : wrote system integration middleware for Fellesdata (NCR CTOS system, C & C++).
- 1990 – 91 : Worked for Unisys Egypt, trying to sell healthcare system to Egyptian military (during Gulf war I). Lived in Cairo during that time. Surreal project.
- 1992 : Wrote screen User interface generator for Metalogic, Luxembourg. Unisys main frame systems. Unisys extended Algol.
- Misc project, wrote election systems, taught Excel Word.

1994 – 97 : Worked for Koc Bank, Unisys Unisys Large systems, Unsiys Extended Algol, DMSII, WFL & Linc. Crazy place. Have stories to tell.

1998 – 01 : Worked mainly in NL, with different companies. Unisys main frames.

2001 – 05 : difficult years, not much work for independent consultants. Wrote a thriller, published by Aschehoug: April 2005.

2005 – 10 : Worked for SWIFT at one of the European two data centres. System: Unisys large systems, emulated on Windows hardware. Last working day 17th December 2010, bicycled to work in snow (Leiden, The Netherlands).

2011 : Moved back to Norway, August.

Been retired since. No programming, a lot Excel. Passion is European train travel, and I’ve become some sort of expert on that. My semi-official title in the Norwegian FB Togferie group (Train Holidays) is ‘Grande Dame des Trains’. Interviewed by Norwegian Radio (NRK) about train travel.

Also I’ve had a career as transwoman activist the last couple of years, mainly on Twitter. And also have been published (and interviewed) by the Norwegian weekly Morgenbladet. Since Twitter now seems to be on a death spiral towards oblivion or something sinister, searching for other platforms at the moment.

Still alive and well and living in The Old Town, Fredrikstad.
