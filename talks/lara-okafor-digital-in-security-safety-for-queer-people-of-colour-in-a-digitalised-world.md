There has been research and journalistic work done that time and again point towards technology not being made with everybody in mind. For queer people of colour, technology can make community and information accessible, at the same time as it can be the gateway to varyingly severe unsafe experiences. There has been research done about queer people and digital safety. There is also some research about people of colour and digital safety. But little attention has been paid to the intersection: queer people of colour's digital safety. Lara Okafor's talk will be based on their thesis with the same title, which is qualitative exploratory research that makes a foray into the experiences of queer people of colour around digital safety.
