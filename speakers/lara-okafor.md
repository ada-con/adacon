Lara Okafor (they/them) is a writer, software developer, and organiser. They are interested in prison abolition, speculative fiction, queerness, and how those topics overlap with technology. Lara has a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Computer Science. They have written a thesis about digital security for queer people of colour, a short story (‘Sevenfold’) which was published in the Norwegian sci-fi anthology ‘A Line Through Gravity’, and several pieces published in the magazines Fett, Billedkunst, and Samora Forum. Lara was one of the project coordinators for the Norwegian documentary film project ‘Loud and Proud: a celebration of Black queer voices’ and was in the organising team for ‘Cutie.BIPoC 2020’ (a festival for queer people of colour). They also hold workshops and talks about topics usually within (and between) the fields of art, technology, and activism.

## Digital (in)security: safety for queer people of colour in a digitalised world

There has been research and journalistic work done that time and again point towards technology not being made with everybody in mind. For queer people of colour, technology can make community and information accessible, at the same time as it can be the gateway to varyingly severe unsafe experiences. There has been research done about queer people and digital safety. There is also some research about people of colour and digital safety. But little attention has been paid to the intersection: queer people of colour's digital safety. Lara Okafor's talk will be based on their thesis with the same title, which is qualitative exploratory research that makes a foray into the experiences of queer people of colour around digital safety.
